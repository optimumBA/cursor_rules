- Use only proper Elixir: don't call functions that don't exist that might be available in other languages.
- Write specs for public function. Private functions don't need @spec.
- When defining a type for a struct, don't put list their keys and value types (`@t :: %__MODULE__{}` is sufficient).
- If there is `@impl` before a function definition, there's no need for `@spec`.
- Avoid using `@impl true`. Instead, specify the module which we are adopting behavior from (e.g. `@impl Phoenix.LiveView`).
- Avoid duplicating code. Refactor shared logic into reusable functions to reduce redundancy.
- Don't add checks for conditions that will never happen.
- Use `Ecto.Enum` type for fields with dropdowns in forms.
