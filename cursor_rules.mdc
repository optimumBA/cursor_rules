- Each rule file should have a clear, descriptive filename using snake_case (e.g., `elixir_code_generation.mdc`).
- All rule files must include metadata header with description, globs, and alwaysApply fields.
- When working with Cursor rule metadata (frontmatter), use terminal commands to view or edit since file reading tools cannot see the metadata. For content-only changes, regular file editing is fine.
- Descriptions should be specific and indicate when the rule applies (technology, context, conditions).
- Use bullet points for concise, actionable guidelines rather than long paragraphs.
- Group related rules into separate files rather than creating monolithic rule files.
- Make rules generic and reusable across different projects when possible.
- For project-specific rules, use conditional language (e.g., "only for projects with internationalization").
- Use proper glob patterns to target specific file types or directories when relevant.
- Set `alwaysApply: false` for most rules to allow context-based application.
- Keep rules focused on a single domain or technology (e.g., separate Elixir and JavaScript rules).
- Update rule descriptions when adding new guidelines to maintain accuracy.
