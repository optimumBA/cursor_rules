- Translations reside in priv/gettext.
- When adding new strings to be translated, use `mix gettext.extract --merge` to generate .pot and .po files.
- Don't change files for English (en).
- Translation files are organized by a domain, e.g. auth.po.
- To add a language, create a directory under priv/gettext (e.g. priv/gettext/en).
- To list .po files run `ls priv/gettext/*/LC_MESSAGES/*.po`.
- If any .po file (not in en) is missing a translation (msgstr field is empty), translate it by filling the msgstr with appropriate translation.
- Check for missing translations with: `make show_missing_translations` to ignore an empty msgstr in the header.
- After making translation changes, run `mix gettext.extract` to ensure consistency.
- Test translations by switching language in the application.
- Keep translations contextually appropriate and consistent with existing terminology in the same domain.
- Never use gettext functions in tests.
