- Before doing any big changes, write down a plan.
- When I ask you to plan something out, write it down in an .md file so I can later reuse it as a context for a new chat session.
- Write down steps as detailed as possible so I can revise it in case I don't like something.
- Do things in stages so I can start a new chat after each stage.
- Ask me if you need any more details.
