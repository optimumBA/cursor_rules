# Optimum Cursor rules

Cursor rules suitable for development using Elixir and Phoenix.

## Setup

Add the repo as a git submodule to your Phoenix app.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/optimumBA/cursor_rules .cursor/rules
```

Rules should automatically be applied by Cursor.  
They can live side-by-side with your existing rules.
