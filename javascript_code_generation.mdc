- When creating javascript hooks for Phoenix LiveView, you do not need to create an index.js file to import the hook. Simply, update the app.js, import the hook like `import FlatpickrCalendar from './hooks/flatpickr_calendar' at the top and update the `Hooks` variable (e.g. `const Hooks = { FlatpickrCalendar }`).
- Always run `mix prettier` to fix formatting issues.
- Do not leave unnecessary comments in the JS file.
- Variable assignments should be sorted alphabetically in an ascending order.
- Import blocks should be sorted alphabetically in an ascending order.
- Data in objects should also be sorted alphabetically in an ascending order.
- Always run `mix prettier` after generating Javascript code to format the files.
- Assets are built automatically so there's no need to run `npm run build`.
