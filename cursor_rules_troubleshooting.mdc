# Cursor Rules: Troubleshooting Guide

## Rules Not Applying

1. **Check frontmatter syntax**: Ensure proper format without quotes
2. **Verify rule type**: Match metadata to intended behavior  
3. **Test description clarity**: For Agent rules, make trigger conditions obvious
4. **Start new chat**: Rules are loaded at chat initialization
5. **Check context overload**: Too many rules can cause AI to ignore some
6. **Rule length check**: Rules over 1,000 words may be ignored due to context overflow

## Editing Problems

1. **Use editor association fix**: Disable custom .mdc editor
2. **Verify file contents via terminal**: Files may appear empty but contain content
3. **Avoid auto-save issues**: Set auto-save to `onFocusChange` or `off` for .mdc files
4. **Check frontmatter visibility**: Use terminal commands to verify metadata (see `cursor_rules_metadata.mdc`)

## Agent Not Following Rules

1. **Check rule relevance**: AI ignores rules it deems unrelated
2. **Simplify rule content**: Focus on actionable, specific guidance
3. **Reduce rule count**: Fewer, higher-quality rules work better
4. **Test with different models**: Some models handle rules better than others
5. **Split large rules**: Break complex rules into focused components
6. **Improve descriptions**: Make trigger conditions more explicit for Agent rules

## Context Overload Symptoms

- Rules that previously worked stop being applied
- AI mentions not having access to certain information
- Inconsistent rule application across similar scenarios
- New rules not being recognized

**Solutions:**
- Audit rule lengths and split rules over 1,000 words
- Remove redundant or obsolete rules
- Consolidate similar rules where appropriate
- Use more specific descriptions to improve relevance matching

## Rule Effectiveness Testing

1. **Monitor application**: Note when rules are used vs ignored
2. **Test in new chats**: Rules are loaded fresh in each session
3. **Check with explicit mentions**: Reference rules with @ to test manual activation
4. **Verify with different queries**: Test rule activation across various scenarios
5. **Review rule descriptions**: Ensure they clearly indicate when to apply
