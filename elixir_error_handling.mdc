- Don't loop more than 3 times when fixing linter errors on the same file.
- On the third attempt, stop and ask for guidance rather than continuing to guess.
- Never hardcode values that only work for specific tests to make them pass.
- Use proper error handling patterns with `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}` tuples.
- Prefer `case` statements over nested `if` conditions for pattern matching.
- Use `with` statements for chaining operations that might fail.
